# Filmmate - NLP Messenger chatbot for movies
 ## Descirption:
 Messenger NLP-based movie chatbot that is implemented using NLU of Wit.ai & NodeJs for the backend.

 ## How it works:
 The bot integrates with the themoviedb API that feeds it with data about a specific movie you have asked for, so all you have to do is to send the message to the bot asking about desired movie (optimised for Serbian language) and you get the asked information as a response on Serbian.
 You can ask chatbot about the details for desired movie such as - when particular movie was released, who directed it, or just ask for summary of movie you are interested in.

 ## Final talk:
 This project is deployed on free dyno on Heruko, so after not usage or spending my free dyno hours that I get each month, it'll go to sleep until I wake him up again. But, if that happend, you know that sleep makes human digest knowledge, so as we, he may come smarter. Greetings up until my next project!
